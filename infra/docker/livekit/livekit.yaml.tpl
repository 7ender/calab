# -dBov, 0 = loudest, so a HIGHER value lets QUIETER speech count (default 35 = −35 dBov; our old
# 30 cut off quiet talkers). A participant is active when above active_level in ≥ min_percentile %
# of the packets of one update_interval window (ms); the level is averaged over smooth_intervals
# windows. Senders run RNNoise + a VAD gate + DTX, so silence is real silence and −40 dBov is safe.
# Changing this needs a LiveKit restart (deploy.sh does it when the rendered config changes).
