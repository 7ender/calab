# LiveKit SIP config TEMPLATE (telephony, ADR-0046). See docs/03-network.md «SIP» and
# docs/06-deployment.md «Телефония».
# Rendered by infra/docker/deploy.sh only when SIP_ENABLED=1, via envsubst, into the env var
# SIP_CONFIG_BODY of the sip service (never written to disk: it carries the Valkey password).
# Only the Valkey password (REDIS_PASSWORD) is substituted; add no other variables. Key/secret: from
# env LIVEKIT_API_KEY / LIVEKIT_API_SECRET (compose.yml).
#
# The service talks to livekit-server over Valkey (psrpc, the same DB 1 as LiveKit and egress)
# and joins rooms over the loopback websocket as the phone line's participant.

# RTP media: 201 ports, BELOW the TURN relay range (20000–29999, livekit.yaml.tpl) and the
