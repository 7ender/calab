/**
 * Update state machine, free of Electron imports so it is unit-tested with a fake updater
 * (updateFlow.test.ts). main/updater.ts wires it to electron-updater, notifications and IPC.
 *
 * Modes, decided per check (settings and the server can change at runtime):
 * - auto   — autoDownload + autoInstallOnAppQuit: background download with progress, then
 *            «Обновление X готово — Перезапустить»; installs on restart or on quit.
 *            ONLY from the build-time feed (review pass 3 B1: an unsigned Windows / AppImage
 *            update is verified by nothing but the sha512 in latest*.yml, served by the same
 *            host — so the host must be the one pinned at build time, never one derived from
 *            the server or set at runtime), and only where the update can be applied: Windows;
 *            Linux AppImage (electron-updater installs nothing else); macOS only when signed
 *            (Squirrel.Mac refuses unsigned updates).
 * - notify — nothing is downloaded: status 'available' + one notification per version that
 *            opens the human download page. Everything else: no build-time feed (dev /
 *            self-built), a runtime feed override, unsigned macOS, Linux deb/other, or
 *            «Автоматически обновлять» off.
 * - manual — notify, but the update is `installable` (build feed + a platform able to apply it;
 *            only the setting is off): «Скачать и установить» in «О программе» calls
 *            download() — the same download / install-on-quit as auto, on the user's request.
 * Errors are logged and end in status 'error' (shown only in «О программе»); never thrown.
 *
 * Checks (docs/09 P1 #16): 10 s after start, then every hour (the period is shifted by a random
 * ±5 min once per run so a fleet of clients does not hit the feed on the hour), «Проверить», and
 * — debounced and at most once per 10 min — after wake from sleep, screen unlock and when the
 * network comes back (the renderer's `online` event). «Проверять обновления автоматически» off →
 * only «Проверить» checks. A call / stream does not defer anything (owner, 30.09): the update
 * downloads in the background and «Перезапустить» restarts at once — prepareRestart hands the
 * voice seat to the relaunched app, which rejoins the same room / 1:1 call (docs/09 #126).
 *
 * A pending download is re-validated against the feed (docs/09 #125, «обновлялись дважды»): the
 * flow used to stop checking once an update was downloaded, so a client that fetched 0.8.0 and ran
 * for days installed 0.8.0 on restart / quit although the feed already said 0.9.0 — and offered
 * 0.9.0 right after the restart. Now, while an update is pending, the feed is read again on the
 * same hourly (± jitter) tick as when idle (with several releases a day a 6 h cadence still left
 * «1.1.0 готово» on screen while 1.3.0 was out — owner, 30.09), on wake / unlock / back online
 * (throttled like any nudge) and right before «Перезапустить» (unless the last check is fresh); a
 * newer version replaces the pending download and «Перезапустить» installs it once ready. A feed
 * offering a version not newer than the running one is ignored (stale mirror).
 *
 * One update, to the newest (owner, 30.09: several releases a day, people restart late). Facts of
 * electron-updater 6.8.9 this relies on (read in node_modules, docs/12 «двойное обновление»):
 * - All platforms keep ONE downloaded file (`<cache>/pending`). Starting the download of a newer
 *   version deletes the older one (DownloadedUpdateHelper.getValidCachedUpdateFile: sha512 of the
 *   cached file ≠ the new one → emptyDir(pending)); a failed download clears it too
 *   (executeDownload → removeFileIfAny → clear()). So once a replacement download starts there is
 *   nothing installable until it ends: `downloadedVersion` is reset, «Перезапустить» waits for the
 *   newer one (installWhenReady), a quit installs nothing (the next start fetches the newest).
 * - Windows NSIS / AppImage install `downloadedUpdateHelper.file` — always the newest downloaded —
 *   from BaseUpdater's `quit` handler, which reads `autoInstallOnAppQuit` live.
 * - macOS: MacUpdater serves the newest downloaded zip to Squirrel.Mac through a local proxy (a new
 *   one per download, setFeedURL) but, with `autoInstallOnAppQuit` on, also makes Squirrel fetch and
 *   STAGE it at download time — and Squirrel installs what it staged on any quit. A newer download
 *   re-feeds Squirrel, but `quitAndInstall()` goes straight to Squirrel once anything was staged
 *   (`squirrelDownloadedUpdate` stays true from the first one), and a quit while the newer one
 *   downloads installs the older staged one: two updates in a row. So on macOS the flow keeps
 *   `autoInstallOnAppQuit` OFF (nothing is staged at download time) and stages itself (env.stage,
 *   Squirrel's own check against MacUpdater's proxy = the newest downloaded file) right before
 *   «Перезапустить» quits and, for install-on-quit, in `will-quit` — the only moments it matters.
 *
 * Install on quit (beforeQuit, wired to `will-quit`): a quit with a pending download re-checks the
 * feed first when the last check is older than QUIT_FRESH_MS (the quit is held at most
 * QUIT_RECHECK_TIMEOUT_MS); a feed newer than the downloaded file → no install on this quit (the next
 * start downloads the newest — one update); same / older feed, a timeout or an error → install:
 * Windows / AppImage through electron-updater's `quit` handler, macOS by staging now (the windows are
 * already closed; ≤ QUIT_STAGE_TIMEOUT_MS). At OS shutdown / logout nothing is awaited: Windows /
 * AppImage decide by the last known feed version, macOS installs nothing (the next start offers the
 * already downloaded update again — no re-download).
